Project History
---------------

__Pareto Anywhere for Azure__ evolved from [pareto-anywhere](https://github.com/reelyactive/pareto-anywhere/), retaining the stateless processing modules such as the [advlib](https://github.com/reelyactive/advlib) libraries, facilitating efficient operation as a stateless Azure Function.

__pareto-anywhere-azure__ was initially prototyped as [aruba-iot-advlib-azure-function](https://github.com/reelyactive/aruba-iot-advlib-azure-function).
